  <text>We got our first moment with a growler today. We raised the trap and there it was, kicking and screaming. The previous research team had a setup ready to sedate the creatures, a massive needle shooting out, stabbing them through the shell. Iâ€™m not getting near that thing, it had bone pieces fly through the air. The growler screamed and thrashed for a while before the sedative kicked in and it fell lifeless to the floor. Max and Teiko pried the mouth open, I tell you these things reek. I can still smell it on my clothes. It was absolutely massive, both Max and Teiko could step inside the mouth to scoop out the soft tissue. My finger hovered over the trigger the entire time, it felt like it would wake up at any moment.
