  <text>I’ve been taking breaks with Davi and the others lately. I was hesitant at first but it has been pretty nice. We either sit in the sofas or play pool. I mostly just listen to Davi, but I’ve gotten to know the others a little bit better as well. Davi is really into music and gave me a playlist to listen to. I normally don’t listen to music and I’ve never done it when working, but it’s kind of nice when you do some of the more monotonous tasks. I still spend most of my time with Ben and I still prefer the quiet we have, but whenever I’m with Davi I don’t mind the noise.
