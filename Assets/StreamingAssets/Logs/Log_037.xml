  <text>I have done some more repairs on the outside. The reapers have stopped ramming the cage and are swimming around watching me and Ben closely. They must’ve realized that they can’t get through. Now and then one would get close and nibble at the cage. I got my first good look at them, and moving around in the water they are surprisingly gracious. Still ugly fuckers though. At least we can work more in peace.
