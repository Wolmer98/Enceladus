  <text>After lunch I stayed way too long listening to Davi’s stories. He was in the military for a while and he has a brother he cares a lot about. After a while I forgot to be intimidated and just listened along. Priya had to come and get us back to work, it was a bit embarrassing getting caught slacking off. She always have this serious look to her, I can’t tell if she’s really mad or not. I might want to talk to Davi more though, I really liked hearing what he had to say.
