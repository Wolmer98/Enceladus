  <text>I just saw the android, had to do a double take since it wasn’t wearing its uniform. Instead it was wearing normal clothes, Omar’s. I knew that Omar struggled with the boundaries between men and androids, but I didn’t think it’d got his far. I should have stopped him much earlier. He hasn’t had the chance to see their true nature.</text>
