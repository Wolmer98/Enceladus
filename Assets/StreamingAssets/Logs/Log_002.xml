  <text>This gel we have been injected with to slow our body clock and induce the coma apparently feels the worst when removed. My body is aching and my head feels like it might explode. It took us six months to get here and even with the gel’s help we’ve lost a lot of muscle. Priya and Teiko is already forcing us to start our training, apparently it will help remove the effects. I’ll correct the artificial gravity and then start running. My body cringes at just the thought of moving but if they say it’ll help I believe them.</text>
