  <text>That android is following Omar everywhere, even into the recreation room. I don’t see the point of having it there, it’s a place for people to hang out. It may look human, but it’s the same cold blooded machine as any other android or robot. They are helpful, but not our friends. Especially not PanPha androids. Androids have to save a lot of data from what it sees and hears, and it will be more than willing to tell PanPha anything about us. Omar isn’t showing up as frequently now either. I know he’s busy, we all are, but I really want to beat him at pool at least once.</text>
