  <text>Ben nicked his jacket and was looking for thread but I stopped him. I’ve never liked the clothes they give the androids, factory issue with a bunch of numbers and a dog collar. I lent him some of my clothes instead and he’s looking good in a t-shirt and working pants. They should be more practical as well.</text>
