  <text>I was a really lousy child, never really grew out of it either. Always studying or working and busy with my own thing. Always too busy to look at the dates. On mother’s day I never were the one to bring my mother a gift or even a call. Instead they were the one who came to my work and left a basket at my desk, even if I was too occupied with my laborations to even give them a hug. If this experiment is successful we’ll get sent back home. It could be mother’s day by the time we’re back. How I wish I could bring them something this time. I know it won’t reverse time, Aluzim is not a miracle pill. It can repair the dying neurons and prevent further damage, not revive what’s already dead. I just wish that I could interfere before they’re forever lost.</text>
