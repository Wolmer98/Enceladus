  <text>Priya mentioned that they’ll turn of the shields to power the cryoextractor. I brought it up to Davi thinking that it was something he was in on, he’s the one responsible for the shields so I figured he had to be involved. Apparently not as Davi stormed out and started yelling as soon as he found Priya. I’ve never seen him that angry but as uncomfortable that made me I did agree with him. Davi should’ve been included in that decision. The commotion made everyone get there and after Davi stormed off again I had everyone’s eyes on me. I went after Davi.</text>
