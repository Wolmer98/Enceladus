  <text>I didn’t want to bring PanPha in to this before the entire team had agreed to the experiment, but Davi and Noémie wasn’t giving me much choice. Even with more leeway to finish the experiment they won’t budge and with the day nearing I had to let PanPha know. If PanPha said no we’d of course have to cancel, but after I had explained all the data and risks, they thought it looked good. They see that we have this planned out and under control. If only Davi could see that as well. The executives even said that if the experiment delivers what we’re estimating, they’ll look into preparing a new mission to the Etna S. One that sends the people and resources necessary to bring Aluzim to the market.</text>
