  <text>I’m keeping all the doors unlocked as we stay here. It’s not like we have to worry about security like the previous researchers had to, they were a lot more people. We’ll all have to work on everything more or less, so there’s no point in keeping places restricted. I’ll leave some key cards around though, in case the system decides to close any of the doors. We don’t want anyone to get trapped.</text>
