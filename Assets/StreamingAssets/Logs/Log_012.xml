  <text>The heating is cranked up and this place is starting to feel livable again. The central heater has been running since this place was evacuated, only running on low output just to keep this place from freezing over. Omar will have to take a look at it and make sure it’s still in a good condition. I’ve spent some time with the shields, making sure they are working as intended. They look to be in good condition, the system hasn’t reported any breeches. This place wouldn’t still be standing without the shields with these geysers erupting. They don’t stop the tremors though, they go through the building like an earthquake everytime one erupts.</text>
