  <text>I’ve always said that the water lock into the growler tank was a dangerous place. I had that confirmed when I opened the door, expecting to only find a big growler trapped in the claw, but instead being jumped at by a pack of small growlers who had clung to the outside. The reason I’m still alive is because Ben threw himself in front of me, protecting me with his body. We couldn’t just shoot them as we would probably have hurt Ben as well. So we had to wait whilst they teared into him and take shots as safe ones presented themselves. By the time the growlers where dead Ben was in critical condition. He’s repairing now but it’s Omar I’m worried about. He hasn’t taken it well.</text>
