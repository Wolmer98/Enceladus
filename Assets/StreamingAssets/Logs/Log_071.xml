  <logName>Banned from the labs</logName>

  <text>I’m not allowed in the labs or where they catch the growlers anymore. Fine, I don’t want any part of their repulsive practises. I don’t know why I took this job, how could I’ve expected anything good to come from PanPha? All they care about is money, not the people they are selling it to or those they run over in their chase for profit. I’m not even mad at Priya for doing this to me, we all know it’s because of Teiko. Can’t even deal with a little criticism so she comes running to Priya for cover.
