  <text>Noémie saw us kill a growler for the first time and I hadn’t anticipated her reaction. She got really angry at how we treated the growler. I agree that the new method is rather gruesome, but these beasts aren’t much worth saving. I let her curse us out. I’ve noticed she gets pretty heated when angry. I told her I’m working on methods to make it better for them and reminded her of what good it would do if we succeeded with our research. It calmed her down somewhat, but she’s still angry. It feels like the anger is not aimed at us now though, more so towards PanPha.</text>
