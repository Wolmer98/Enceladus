  <text>I hadn’t really noticed how much Omar had started to mean to me before I couldn’t talk to him anymore. A classic tale, I suppose. I always thought I was a person who knew how to appreciate what I had yet I managed to take his company for granted. The people here are always stressed, busy and doesn’t have the time or interest for anyone else. Omar is as busy as any of us but he was never like that, he liked to hear my tales and stories and I liked how happy he was to see me. I have to talk to him.</text>
