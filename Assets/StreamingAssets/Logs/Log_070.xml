  <text>Max asked me if I could use the information we have about the creatures’ weak spots to make a sight that highlights them. I was working on it alone when Davi found me. Ben was needed somewhere else. Since it’s a weapon attachment he offered to help me out. He taught me some things about sights that I hadn’t thought about before. Working with Davi is different from doing it with Ben. With Ben it’s quiet and focused but with Davi it’s a mix of getting a lot done one moment and then messing around another. He’ll say something to make me laugh or go off on a tangent. I’ve always considered my job fun, but I haven’t had the kind of fun where you burst out laughing doing it before.</text>
