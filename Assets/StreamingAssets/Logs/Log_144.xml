  <text>Davi keep telling me that I’m letting PanPha get too me too much, or that I’m thinking too highly of them. I’m not really surprised he thinks like that, he hasn’t really worked with PanPha before and the public opinion of the company isn’t always great. Pangea Pharmaceuticals is the largest pharmaceutical company in the world and there’s a lot of pressure and responsibilities that comes with that. In the end of the day they try to make the world a better and healthier place, but doing so has its costs. People are complaining about the prices of the drugs but that is what funds expeditions like this one. PanPha isn’t afraid to try find new cures and treatments, this expedition is for dementia. Progress isn’t free and PanPha does the best they can, I wish more people would see that.</text>
