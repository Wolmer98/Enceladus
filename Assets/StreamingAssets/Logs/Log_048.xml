  <text>Omar asked me about my eye. It got hit by the shrapnel from a grenade. It could probably have been saved if i’d turned back directly and gone to the medics, but I stayed to finish my mission. I should’ve turned back, but I was young, silly and wanted to impress others. The one I wanted to impress the most was my brother, but instead I just made him furious with me. But it made him notice me, so I did more stupid shit after that. After he joined the special ops he was to busy to even give me a chiding and then he was gone. I didn’t tell Omar all that though, I’m sure he’s more interested in the tech of my new eye than my life story.
