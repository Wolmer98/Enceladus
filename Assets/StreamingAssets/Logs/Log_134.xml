  <text>The last few days we’ve prepared for a small scale experiment that uses the cold to extract the substance. It was a success, after all these months I finally have some D77 in my hands. Or in a bottle, it’s a liquid after all. It’s a very small dose, too small to do anything with it, but we make some more and it’ll be ready to be sent back to PanPha’s laboratoriums and have it made into Aluzim.</text>
