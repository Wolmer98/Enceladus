  <text>I thought Noémie got over her infatuation with the creatures after we were attacked. I thought we had started to become friends. I feel silly now, for thinking that. I went to tell her when we’re going to run the experiment, only to find her like the last few weeks hadn’t happened. She was being disagreeable and saying we should stop all this and leave. She was supposed to be on our side in this, I confided in her. But at her first chance to side with the monsters she threw all of that away.</text>
