  <text>A new theory they want to test requires the growler to not be sedated. I was tasked to target the weaker spots on their legs to make the creature bleed out. Even hitting their weak spots the creature was strong and lived for a long time. It was a bit disturbing, hearing it scream. To watch it struggle. Iâ€™m going to look into making some upgrades to the weapons, I think I know some ways that could improve their performance.</text>
