  <text>I went outside for the first time, strapped on the wetsuit and had a look at the exterior. There are cages strapped to the outside that allows us to get out there safely. They look a bit like shark cages and certainly reminded me of them as some creature rammed into its side, biting into the metal bars. Reapers, hideous half fish beasts with arms. Got their name from their head shape‘s similarity to a grim reaper's hood. They attack and then back away into the dark water. I never knew when or where they’d appear. I still managed to get some work done, but it’s awkward to work around the cage. I might take the android with me next time.</text>
