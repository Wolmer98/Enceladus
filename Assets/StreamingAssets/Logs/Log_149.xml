  <text>The plan worked and I got to talk to Omar. I told him everything, that I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done what I did and I told him about my experiences with androids. He didn’t say a thing, only listened. The silence could’ve killed me. After I told him everything, Omar told me about him growing up, the friendship and support he’s received from androids in his life. About his friend Neo who he learnt to repair electronics together with. He insisted that these androids are different from the machines in the wars, that they didn’t have a bad bone in their body. I can’t see them like he does. They might not be murderous, but they are all programming. They’re not real people. I didn’t tell Omar that though, but I promised that I’ll give Ben a chance. That’s my only way of regaining his friendship.</text>
