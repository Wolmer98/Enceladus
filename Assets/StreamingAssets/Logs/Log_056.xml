  <text>Weâ€™ve tried everything we could think of and the substance still falls apart in the process. I have this theory that the sedative we use might interfere with our methods. The last growler we picked up we did not sedate. Instead we targeted the fleshy parts of the legs and had the creature bleed out. It was a time consuming method, but it keeps the specimen as intact as possible.</text>
