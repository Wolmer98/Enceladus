  <text>I had a chance to talk to Seth today in the communications center. It was good to see a friendly face. Matthieu still doesn’t want to see me, I can’t blame him. I wasn’t exactly there for them when they grew up, always away working. Seth tells me how Matthieu’s doing though, he’s in uni. I always knew he was a smart boy. Seth is working right now but I’m trying to convince him to study further as well, I’ll send the money. He’s stubborn though and insists that he has a plan, reminds me of someone.</text>
