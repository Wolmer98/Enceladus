  <text>I got my hands on my first specimen. A growler, big for its kind, at least 20 cm bigger in diameter than ones mentioned in the files. Growlers come in multiple types and sizes, the big ones are rarer and tougher but the amount of tissue you can get from them will last us for quite a while. Nasty creatures, quite thrilling to willingly step into one of themâ€™s mouths to scrape out the soft tissue.
