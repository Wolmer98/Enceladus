  <text>We threw Priya a party. It was Davi’s idea, he has some good ones now and then. I haven’t seen Priya so relaxed since, since I don’t even know when. I know she is under a lot of pressure but I wish she’d share it a bit more with us instead of keeping it all to herself. It feels like she’s trying to be too many things, a good leader, a good mother, an ideal employee. She’ll be neither if she works herself to death.</text>
