  <text>Priya said I didn’t have to focus as much on outside repairs and to look at the growler tank more. It’ll take some time for the water in the tank to heat back up and the growlers are still rampaging. I’ll miss the reapers though, I like the sounds they make as I’m working. The growlers scream and try to escape their confinement. Not as cozy.</text>
