  <text>We’ve been continuing the research in the cold and there’s been some issues with that, we even had to use half-frozen tissue for the tests. But what it showed was very promising. We’ve been looking for something to keep the substance intact while we extract it and the cold appears to be able to do that. It took longer than usual for it to fall apart. We’ll have to do more tests where we utilize cold.</text>
