  <text>Ever since my husband died my goal has been to rise to the top and get employed at a big company, PanPha being one of the biggest. I finished my medical degree because I knew it would give me an edge on the market. It’s not strange that people think I’m only here to climb, because it’s true. I have nothing else but my research. Being the doctor is a burden, I’m forced to care and look after the crew, knowing that I’m the only one that can help them. I don’t want to be attached to people’s lives but I can’t seem to avoid it.</text>
