  <text>I had one last trip outside. Not repairing anything or something like that. Just spending time in the water with the reapers. They are so comfortable around me now, resting on top of the cage, playing with each other. Will they be so unsuspecting towards other humans as well? They can’t trust them like they trust me. They’ll come with their guns ready. The experiment is soon, but I don’t know how soon. I’m not keeping track. I’m staying away and doing whatever I feel like. I figure I’ll notice sooner or later how it goes.</text>
