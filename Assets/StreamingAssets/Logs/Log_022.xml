  <text>They want access to the lower floors but the elevator is flooded. I’ve taken a peek at it and I’ll probably have to fix it from the outside. I hope that I’m wrong, but I won’t know for sure until I’ve taken a closer look. I’ve done underwater repairs before with no problem, but the things out there freak me out. I spotted one through a window, they look much worse than in the files.</text>
