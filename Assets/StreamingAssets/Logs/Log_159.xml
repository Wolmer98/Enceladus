  <text>I can tell it isn’t easy for Davi to talk to Ben. I’m not sure what I can do to help, I want them to get along. It’s still early though, there’s time. He’s trying. He’s even making sure to call Ben by his name. I thought it would be the end after we had our fight, yet here we are seeing if we can make it work. I haven’t really had any conflicts with people before, at least not anything this severe. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do. I don’t know why Davi tries so hard to make it work, it feels like I wouldn’t be worth the effort. I guess I mean something to him then, even if as a friend.</text>
