  <text>We’re all frustrated by our lack of progress but Teiko is taking it too far, blaming it all on Noémie. I did as she said and had her removed from the research areas, that is more than she could expect. Noémie is brilliant, that’s why they chose her. The knowledge and skill she’s gained from working can’t be found at any university. We wouldn’t have been able to use this place without her skill, considering how rundown this place is. I’ve put restrictions on Noémie so it’s only fair to do the same for Teiko, - she’s not allowed to talk down on Noémie any longer.
