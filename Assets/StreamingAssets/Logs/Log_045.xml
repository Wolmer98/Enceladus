  <text> I got the chance to see Kasim and Lathika today. She’s grown so much in just a few months, but she’ll always be my little baby girl. It’s my first time going on a mission since she was born and the last few months must have felt very long for her. I’m going to call her as much as PanPha can allow me to, now that we’ve arrived and are awake. I already miss her so much. Kasim will look after her and I’ll have to look after the crew. Some of us don’t know each other very well yet, but I’m glad to see that they are mostly getting along. Even Omar is talking to others than the android.
