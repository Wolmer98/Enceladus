  <text>Omar is back to working on the cryoextractor. I told him too. I know he’s already in trouble with PanPha and can’t really afford going against Priya. I also know that refusing would’ve eaten at him, he’s too dutiful. Only issue is that now they’ll have a fully working cryoexractor and the only thing that will stop them from going through with it is Priya’s word. Priya is many things, but I don’t think she’s a straight out liar. It’s lonely without Omar here, Noémie is who knows where so I’m rolling my thumbs on my own.</text>
