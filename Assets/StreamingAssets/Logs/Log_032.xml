  <text>Omar got hurt, he was repairing the machinery in the room that got flooded when something failed and exploded. He’s not badly hurt, but he hit the wall pretty hard and got knocked out. Ben carried him here and waited until the boy woke up. I’m glad Omar has a friend here, he always looks so uncomfortable around the rest of us.</text>
