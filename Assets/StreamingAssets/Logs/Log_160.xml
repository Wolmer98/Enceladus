  <text>We have produced enough D77 for maybe a few pills. I’ve told Priya about my idea of scaling the experiment up and I can tell that she isn’t entirely against it. I might be able to convince her to try make it happen. We only need it to work for one run, so we can convince PanPha that it’s something worth investing more in and send more resources to.</text>
