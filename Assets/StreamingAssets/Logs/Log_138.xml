  <text>They’ve finally managed to produce some D77. I’m happy for them, I know it has been very difficult. Max said it was thanks to the cold that they came up with the idea. I think they tried to cheer me up. I’m glad it was of help, but it was still a mistake on my part. It’s a weird model with a strange fault to it, but it’s my job to have noticed it. I’ll work hard from here on and hopefully I can redeem myself to PanPha. If I lose my job like this I won’t forgive myself.</text>
