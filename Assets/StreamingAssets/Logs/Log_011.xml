  <text>I swear the artificial gravity is a little bit off. It’s supposed to mimic earth gravity but I feel heavy and slow, even counting the muscle loss. That’s a reasonable thing to bring up to Davi to check, right? Yet Noémie couldn’t stop herself from making a snide remark. You’ll thank me for not having to run around in too high gravity after a few months.</text>
