  <text>Priya asked me if the shields could be turned off, of course they can, only they are so important I’ve spent all these months here making sure they are running perfectly. Would a geyser hit us without the shields’ protection it would tear this place apart. She dropped it after that, walked off looking all distracted. She worries me, looking so stressed. I thought she’d be able to relax a little because of our breakthrough with the cold, but she looks as pressured as ever. I knew PanPha were hard but it’s another thing seeing it in person. Not in a million years would I want to take over Priya’s role.</text>
