  <text>We’ve started to analyze the tissue and so far all we got is that yes, the creatures does indeed contain D77. The files said that much already, the exciting part is how we’ll manage to extract it. It’s a fickle substance and breaks apart easily, that’s why it’s so rare to begin with. The substance seems to be fused together with the soft tissue of the sea life here, but we need it in raw form to make the drug.
