  <text>I’m back to talking to Omar again, but there’s never a moment Ben isn’t there. I can ignore it for the most part but I have to talk to him at times. I promised I’d try so I’m doing that, and Omar said he’d be patient. He’s made it clear that the android stays so if I can’t handle that I might get kicked again. He’s been more forward and talkative lately, sharing stories from Jabud or talking about technology. He’s a good story teller, he puts a surprising amount of energy into what he’s passionate about. I’m not always a great listener but I find myself paying attention, trying the memorize the people’s names. I haven’t had someone close to me like him in a long time and I don’t want to let it go easily.</text>
