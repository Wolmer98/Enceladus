  <text>Teiko and I ran the numbers and we predict that there will be a golden opportunity for us to run the experiment in 15 days. Before then we have to get all the preparations ready. Priya will have to work on convincing the last of our crew to join us. I know Priya can do it, they’ve always had what’s necessary to lead. We’ve come a long way, Priya and I, to make this happen. Ever since my mother got diagnosed with alzheimer’s four years ago this has been a dream of mine.</text>
