  <text>If anyone is going to turn off the shields it should be me. I know them the best and will be able to get them back on the quickest. Even if I’m mad at them, I’m also going into the labs again. Omar is feeling very lonely, especially without Ben with him. I shouldn’t leave him as well. Ben’s still repairing. Omar’s clinging to the hope that he’ll be fine. I’d prefer not to be the reason for his decommission as well. I try not to think about what would happen if we fail too much, but my mind has never been very good at keeping away from unpleasantries. I keep thinking of my brother and the stubborn hope I’ve had all these years that I’ll see him again. I’ve even had some thoughts about the rest of my family, if I make it out I should give them a call.</text>
