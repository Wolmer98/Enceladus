  <text>It feels good to finally be able to report some good news to PanPha. Max is positive that we’re on the right track and I’ve sent them the data that support their claim. The executives looked happy about the news, they didn’t even nag me about what our mission is costing them or how their approval is plummeting within the masses. We always knew getting permission to get here and use the alien life wouldn’t be popular, but that the results and treatment for dementia would make up for it. It’s time to make up for it.</text>
