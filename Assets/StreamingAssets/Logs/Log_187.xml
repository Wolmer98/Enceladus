  <text>Omar is back on the team. I was a little bit worried since he’s very close with Davi, but it seems like he understand things better than I gave him credit for. We can’t finish the cryoextractor without him. Davi is being stubborn and Noémie has lost faith in what we’re doing here. I’m a bit disappointed in Noémie, I thought she was a woman who knew what had to be done. That’s at least what her previous employers had to say about her. Her constructions work is top-of-the-line, but maybe Teiko was right and we should’ve brought someone with a more fitting mindset. We’ll have to work on getting them on our side, at the same time the preparations are going along nicely.</text>
