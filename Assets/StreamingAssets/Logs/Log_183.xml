  <text>Priya came to talk to me again, she’s trying to get me over to her side on this. A bit late for that, I’m done with this thing. I don’t care about the risks that much, it’s everything else that bothers me. Especially Priya. She says that she won’t go through with the mission without every crewmembers approval. Trying to make it sound like I matter? Then prove it by not doing the experiment, because they won’t get my consent. Enceladus isn’t a big moon and doesn’t have too many species on it. They’ll run out of growlers and then gather up the rest. The stingers, belchers, lurkers and then, reapers. They’ll strip this planet clean, possibly introducing a mating program to continue the production. I don’t think I want to see that happen.</text>
