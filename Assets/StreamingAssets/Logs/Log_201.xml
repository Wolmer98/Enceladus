  <text>Tomorrow is the day. We hit some bumps, some snags, didn’t have everyone with us, but now it’s here. All the calculations are run, all the preparations are made so we’re just waiting for that perfect moment to appear where we can begin the final experiment. When we’re home we’ll begin with the preparations for the next expedition where I’ll be guaranteed a good spot. Don’t miss us to much Etna S, we’ll be back in a heartbeat.</text>
