  <text>I think I was the only one who didn’t know about this big experiment in some way. But I’m just a constructor, I don’t need to know about what’s going on in the labs. Even when it risks all of our lives. I’ve seen Davi angry before, always because of safety, but never like this. I’m inclined to believe him when he says the risk is too great. Davi left after Priya made it clear that she’d made up her mind and Omar followed him. Priya, Max and Teiko started to make plans. Shouldn’t there be a vote about things like this? I didn’t stay long either. I said I would do my job but, this is something else.</text>
