  <text>Ben asked me to come with him, I was surprised but of course I followed, only to find Davi waiting for me. I’ve tried to avoid him and I hadn’t expected him to use Ben to get to me. Anyway with little other choice we had a talk. Davi said that he’s sorry and then told me why he doesn’t like androids. He told me about the androids he met during his time as a soldier. Callous, deadly, programmed without mercy or regard. I’ll have to admit that his story made me shudder, it sounded like a nightmare. None of his previous stories about the war were like this. Davi told me how he struggled to see normal androids any different, there was just some extra code to make them cover it up. It worried him to see Ben so close to me. I can see where he came from, but I still disagree with the sentiment. I told him about my experiences with androids, and why I find them so trustworthy.</text>
