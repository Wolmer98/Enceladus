  <text>Nobody would let me work as a doctor without a proper medical degree. Max didn’t move to their position in PanPha’s research team without years and years of studying and degrees in multiple subjects. Me, Priya and Davi have all degrees in biochemistry which qualifies us for the research. Omar was really talented with machines and tech before PanPha took him in, but they gave him a proper education in engineering and programming before they let him work for them. Noémie however, hasn’t even gone to as much as a community college. Working experience is vital, but I would never be this good if I just started to cut into people and figure it out along the way.</text>
