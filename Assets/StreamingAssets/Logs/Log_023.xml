  <text>We’re settling in. Ben is cleaning up some old living quarters, so tonight we’ll have proper beds to sleep on. I don’t know when they found the time, but Teiko and Noémie has managed to draw bad blood between them. I’m not surprised Teiko is kicking up a fuss, and if it was just her, I could handle it. Unfortunately Noémie seems to be just as stubborn. When we repair more of the place and it becomes a bit less cramped, it will hopefully calm down. Just another thing to keep an eye on.</text>
