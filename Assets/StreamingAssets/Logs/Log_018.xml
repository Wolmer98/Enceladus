  <text>Getting started is taking longer than I would have wished. Everyone is doing their work, it’s just more that needed to be done than anticipated. PanPha hasn’t said anything yet, but I know their patience is limited. They have already waited six months for us to even get here. It wasn’t easy to get permission for this place. It’s still not widely accepted for commercial companies to get access to our celestial bodies, but if we bring positive results, I’m sure they will warm up to the idea.</text>
