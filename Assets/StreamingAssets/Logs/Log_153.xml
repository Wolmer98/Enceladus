  <text>I had an unexpected talk with Teiko. She wants me to keep Noémie inside. Their relationship has improved since the accident and while I’m happy about it I’m not naïve enough to have hopes of it holding. Teiko can be pretty emotional, doubly so about Noémie, probably because her husband passed away doing what Noémie does. But Teiko couldn’t even avoid arguing with Ingmar and I doubt Noémie is as patient. For the time being however I won’t force Noémie to work on the outside. I will not stop her if she does so on her own though.</text>
