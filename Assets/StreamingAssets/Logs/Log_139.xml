  <text>I’ve realized that there’s no point in getting angry at anyone here from the Gaia 7. I do think they genuinely want to help people, although they are prepared to sacrifice some things I’m not. The problem lies with PanPha, who doesn’t hesitate to bribe and buy their way to new sources of cash. We all know that if they manage to commercialize Aluzim they will bleed their customers dry for it, and this moon.</text>
