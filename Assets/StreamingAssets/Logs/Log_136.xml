  <text>We’ve have had some breakthrough with the research. Not thanks to me, the others that did all the good work. It’s nice that something’s happening, we’ve been stuck for so long. Might be good if we can wrap this mission up as well, I’m starting to desperately want to get away from these confines. Omar turns around as soon as he sees me, I want to talk to him but he won’t let me. I want to at least have a talk you know, to explain my side of things. I haven’t just decided to not trust androids, I used to like them too.</text>
