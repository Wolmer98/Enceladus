  <text>We got everyone’s permission to go ahead with the experiment. I knew Priya would manage, she’s tougher than she looks. Calling in PanPha like that? Remind me not to get on her bad side. I’m still hesitant to let them close to the cryoextractor, we don’t want any sabotage. Omar is too much of a good kid to do anything, but Noémie we’ll have to keep a close eye on. Luckily she’s still banned from the labs, good thing I didn’t have that revoked. Had she kept her act up a bit longer, she could’ve had quite the opportunity to destroy us from the inside. Brains, however, were never her strong suit.</text>
