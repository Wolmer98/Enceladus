  <text>I’ve been looking into if we could perform the bigger test Max has been talking about. PanPha is still patient with us, but I don’t want to fall out of their favor again. I’m going to make things happen before then. Problem is that the test requires an immense amount of energy and we’re running on a limited supply. I know Davi has looked into the electricity of this place so I asked him about what we could potentially turn off. He said the shields that protect the base from the geyser eruptions are our biggest energy consumers. He also said they were to under no circumstances be turned off, but I wonder… It would solve our problem.</text>
