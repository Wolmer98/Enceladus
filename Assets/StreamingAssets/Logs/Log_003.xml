  <text>The base is quite run down, but it could’ve been much worse. It looks mostly intact and there seems to be a lot of materials lying around for repairs. The previous research team left most of the things when they abandoned this place, everything from raw materials to machines are still here. I can’t wait to start working, removing this rust from myself and this place.</text>
