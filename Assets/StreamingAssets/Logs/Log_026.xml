  <text>I’m in the middle of setting up the med station. We can’t rely on help from anyone else so I have everything here, everything from treatments of physical wounds to disease and psychological problems. Sometimes it’s good to be employed by the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, as these are some high end stuff. Like this nifty little pill that stops brain hemorrhage. I could send one over to Noémie. I seriously don’t get her problem, it’s like she’s trying to drive me crazy.</text>
