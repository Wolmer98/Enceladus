  <text>We need more growlers for the research but we can hardly grab a living one now that they’re so agitated. We have some dead ones preserved - Max had an idea how preservation might change the flesh in a way that aids the extraction of the substance. We put them in just before the heating failed so nothing should have happened to them yet, they’ll be like any dead growler. Only problem is that Noémie is going to be there, she’s making repairs to the tank. She told me I should wait until she’d secured the place, I didn’t know we were back on speaking terms.</text>
