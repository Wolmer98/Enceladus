  <text>It has been a few days, it’s a bit weird, I barely know these people. We got introduced and did some training together leading up to the launch, but now we’re living together. They are all older than me, only Davi being close to me in age and they all have a lot more experience. It feels weird to have gone from fixing people’s electronics for a little cash to all this. I don’t really know how to talk to any of them but Ben. I had some android friends back home and they are always so easy to be around.</text>
