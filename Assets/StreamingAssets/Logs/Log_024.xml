  <text>All of the creatures on Enceladus are blind. The ice blocks any light from getting down here, so they never bothered developing eyesight. Instead they rely on different combinations of smell, hearing, echolocation and lateral lines. Growlers are very good at sensing prey through vibrations. They canâ€™t swim so they stalk the ocean floor, devouring anything that reaches the bottom. Messy eaters, those things. They use their antennae-arms to bring things to its mouth, the big mouth holds it down and the small one does the eating, like a leech.</text>
