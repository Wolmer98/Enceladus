  <text>Omar is starting to look homesick. We’ve been here a while and this is his first time going out in space like this. I asked him about his family, he has a big one with seven siblings and many cousins. He grew up in Jabud, I’ve never been there but I’ve heard nothing good about it. Too crowded and poor. Must’ve been difficult. Listening to him made me think of my brother a lot, I wish I knew how he was doing. I tried to reassure Omar that time would pass in an instant and he’d be soon back with them. I wouldn’t mind if that instant turns out to be a little bit longer. I have nothing back home.
