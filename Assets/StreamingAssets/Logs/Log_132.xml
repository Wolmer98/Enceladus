  <text>I’ve always liked puzzles. I like finding the patterns and coming up with a solution to the problems. Machines are very similar to puzzles, there are the different parts that creates the whole, and making and repairing them requires you to use similar methods. People however, are different. Even if there’s a problem there isn’t sure to be a solution. I think we’ll have the heater repaired very soon, there’s some parts that doesn’t really make sense to me yet but once you’ve started upon a solution the rest is sure to follow.</text>
