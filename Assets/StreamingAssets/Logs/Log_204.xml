  <text>I’ve looked over everything, so has Teiko and Max. If there was anything wrong, one of us would’ve noticed. The closer the hour comes the more certain I feel that we’re doing the right thing. I’ve been doubting, worrying and fretting, but that is all but gone now. Now I’m only filled with quiet anticipation. PanPha must be sitting impatiently on the other side of the communicator, waiting for our news. In a few hours I’ll be able to tell them whatever happened.</text>
