  <text>I miss my family. I’ve only been able to call them once since we got here. Their internet doesn’t allow intergalactic communication. Admittedly not the first thing you look for when getting it. You look at the price. They’ll have to travel to the PanPha lab in Jabud to talk to me. I should contact PanPha and ask if they can’t book another call with them. I know they’re all very busy but I want to see their faces, if only for a short moment.
