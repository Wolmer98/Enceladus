  <text>We just got in contact with Noémie and Teiko, they are stuck in a water lock after a growler breached and flooded the room they were in. I’ve sent Ben to get the cage to them and take them back to us from the outside. They’ll have to endure the icy water but it’s the only way to get to them. We’ve collected all the heaters and are ready to take care of them.</text>
