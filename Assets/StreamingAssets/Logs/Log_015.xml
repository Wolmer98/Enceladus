  <text>I’ve been trying to secure some rooms so that the team can get started. That includes fixing leaks, ensuring the walls integrity, looking for damage and much more. It’s slow work and I don’t want anyone else there until I’ve given it a clear. The team seems to get it fine, don’t walk in somewhere that hasn’t been cleared or put yourself at extreme risk. Teiko, however, I’m not sure if some brain tissue leaked out together with the gel. She waltz right in an unstable area making claims to the machinery there. The machines I couldn’t care less about, but you aren’t entering any rooms I haven’t secured.</text>
