  <text>The other have their hands full so I’m going to help Davi fetch some growlers from the tank. I’ve seen it done before but I have never done it myself. I’m a bit nervous, the growlers creep me out. They have no eyes but it always feel like they know exactly where you are. Ben and Davi are going to be with me though, so it should be fine. Davi has opened up a lot more lately, I feel like the both of us can be more honest with each other. I really hope we can make it work.</text>
