  <text>The temperature is dropping and by the looks of things it’s going to stay like this for a while. Whenever I see Omar he’s lost in thought trying to fix the problem. We’re still continuing the research but the cold definitely complicates things. The labs are one of the warmer rooms with all the working machines but it’s still ice cold. I fall asleep to the sound of my clattering teeth.</text>
