  <text>Me and Teiko had dinner at the same time tonight. Was quiet and a bit awkward, then Teiko spoke up. She asked about my previous contracting jobs of all things. I mean if she wants to try to be civil I won’t stop her, so I told her. Must say she picked up the things I was talking about rather quickly. I haven’t had a serious talk with her before, I guess I can see what Max and Priya sees in her if she’s like this at work. I’m sure she’ll be back to bitching in no time though, but I’ll enjoy the peace while it lasts.</text>
