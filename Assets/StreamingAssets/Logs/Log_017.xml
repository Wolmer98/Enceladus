  <text>We finally have a lab cleared and ready to be used. The machinery is a bit dated but we’re bringing some of our own tools and the kid is working on some upgrades to the tech. But this will be enough to get started, I’ve stayed idle for long enough. My hands are aching to get to work on their first growler. Encelus formicarcinus, as they are also called. Blind crablike creatures that live on the bottom of the ocean. Ideal for our testing since they have large areas of soft tissue, not bones or much else in the way.</text>
