  <text>I don’t know when or how they found the time, but Teiko and Noémie are already not getting along. They seemed fine back at the introduction. I guess living close to people brings the worst out of each other. I’m not really good with people fighting so I try to keep away, and luckily I have a lot of work I can focus on. Davi has visited me a few times, maybe he gets tired of the bickering as well. He talks a bit as I’m working, before he has to go somewhere else. He’s really knowledgeable of weapons and he has many stories to tell. I like to hear him talk, his voice is very soothing.</text>
