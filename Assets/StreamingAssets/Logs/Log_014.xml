  <text>I’ve noticed that Omar has given the android a name. Naming androids actually have some proven positive results. Children are more likely to treat androids with politeness and respect if the android they meet has a name. Some people think it’s fine for their children to treat androids like trash or toys, because they are machines. I think they look far too similar to real people for that to be a good lesson for the kids. It’s desensitizing violence. Lathika would never be allowed to do that.</text>
