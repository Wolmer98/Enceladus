  <text>I was working late as usual, only when I turned around I didn’t find food there like I usually do. Priya mentioned the android got hurt, I didn’t reflect on it much then. Ben always checked in on me, I’ll have to manage without that. We’re getting work done on the new, bigger cryoextractor. The kid is doing a marvelous job.</text>
