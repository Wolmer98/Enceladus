  <text>The base is starting to feel quite suffocating. There’s nowhere you can go without running into Teiko. The calm of the outside is growing on me, even with my grisly audience. If they could get to me I have no doubt they’d rip me to tiny pieces and call for a feast, but since they can’t they are curiously watching us, and we watch them. They seem pretty intelligent, and not as vicious as I first thought. I feel like the first impression I had of them wasn’t entirely fair.
