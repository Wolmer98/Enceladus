  <text>Teiko came by. She’s excited to run their experiment. I tried to convince her that this experiment was a bad idea and with a few words, she was back to the old Teiko again. We never had anything but a hollow friendship between us, one that couldn’t last. We’re too clashing, Teiko and I, and I appreciate having that clear instead of the uncertainty of where we stood. I’m not changing my mind, nothing Priya says or does can convince me to do so. This experiment is under Priya’s orders, not PanPha’s, so with Davi’s assurance of the risks I can refuse scot-free.</text>
