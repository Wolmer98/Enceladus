  <text>Woke up to a bad dream again. This time it was about my brother. I kept seeing him dying in distant parts of space. My dreams are usually about things I’ve seen happen, this I haven’t but it still puts me ill at ease. Because I don’t know that it isn’t true. We only get a letter once every one or two years, supposedly from him. Even if they aren’t, I anxiously wait for the next one.</text>
