  <text>Davi mentioned that he has a brother, it was kind of fleeting so I’m guessing it’s a sensitive subject. Well it’s hard for family not to be one, we’re far away from them and won’t see them for a long time. Nijah should have started school now, I wonder if she likes it, if she’s made any friends. Aharon will graduate from college whilst I’m here. I’m sad that I’ll miss it but it’s because of PanPha and this job we could afford to send him. If PanPha hadn’t scouted me and taken me in I’d probably ended up working in Jurgen’s store, servicing old appliances. I’m very grateful for this chance we’ve received.
