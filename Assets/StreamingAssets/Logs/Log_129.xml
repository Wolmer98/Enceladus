  <text>Max came up with an idea that we’re testing now, we have barely started and we already have things to show for it. I’m too happy to even be mad at Noémie, I shared her the good news myself when I passed her by. She congratulated us, gosh I can’t recognize either of us now. What’s become of us? Ever since the accident it has been weird. But enough thinking about that grump, I’ve got work to attend to.</text>
