  <text>I just watched something disturbing. The growlers are not calming down so I checked the cameras inside the growler tanks. They were fighting each other and the ones that fell got eaten. They are not being fed are they? Growlers are the only creatures I know they are catching and we don’t have the meat enough to feed them with us. So they are being starved. Now I won’t be able to hear their growls throughout the base without being reminded of their suffering. I have to find Priya.</text>
