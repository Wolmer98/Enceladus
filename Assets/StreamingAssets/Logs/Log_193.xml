  <text>Is this what Priya meant with our permission? She’ll use PanPha to get it from us? Our opinion truly never mattered to her then. I talked to Davi and even he couldn’t convince PanPha otherwise. They are all mad. And I’m even madder because I’ll let them do it. I don’t have much choice, PanPha would ruin me. Since they are so sure it’s safe, let’s do it. I’ll save the fight until I get back home and not under PanPha’s employment anymore. Then I will join ALP, or anyone who has a chance against them.</text>
