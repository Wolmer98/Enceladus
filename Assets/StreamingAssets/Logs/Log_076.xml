  <text>Nothing beats the calm of the outside these days. Well, calm might be the wrong word for it, the reapers sure are energetic. I think they’ve become quite comfortable around me, they play around and sing to each other. I can’t really place the sound, I suppose it’s a bit whale like? Like ghost whales. They seem happy though, unlike the bitter and boring people inside.
