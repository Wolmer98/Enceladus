  <text>We’re closing in on hour zero. At least we’ll have our answers soon, to see who’s right. Priya is keeping her cool but the bags under her eyes doesn’t lie. She hasn’t gotten a minute more sleep than I have. Noémie is nowhere to be seen. Omar hasn’t left my side, but he’ll have to soon. I’ll have to go to the control room, and he to the labs. I’ll have to figure out something to say to him. I’m not sure what that’d be, I’ve never been good with goodbyes.</text>
