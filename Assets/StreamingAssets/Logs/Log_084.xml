  <text>Funny hasn’t been eating its food and has been looking lethargic all day. I tried to have Teiko take a look at them, but apparently Teiko isn’t a “doctor for hamsters”. How different can they be? We all eat, sleep, shit and got a circulatory system. Priya doesn’t hold such inhibitions and got some antibiotics for it. Teiko came yelling that they were toxic for hamsters and they’d take care for it. I guess Teiko is a doctor for hamsters after all.</text>
