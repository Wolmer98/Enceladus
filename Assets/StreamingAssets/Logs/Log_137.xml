  <text>I shared the good news with PanPha. They were delighted, but pointed out that it was a very small amount we’d managed to produce. I ensured them that was because we haven’t had any time to refine our procedure yet. Couldn’t they be happy for us for more than just a second? It took a lot of work to get this far. We’ll soon be able to produce much more satisfying results. Yet even if they are quick to see the negative, I haven’t had PanPha so supportive of what we’re doing in such a long time. It feels nice to have regained some faith.</text>
