  <text>It’s almost the day. I’m strangely nervous, even if I know we’ll be fine. I wish I could call my family. Or run around. Or do anything. I’m still working on the cryoextractor but it’s nothing more than polish. Davi is joining me in the labs now. He’s been very nice lately, can’t say I dislike that but I feel like it comes from the wrong place. Like he’s given up on the idea that we’ll be alright. I’m grateful that Davi and I are friends again. I don’t know how I’d dealt with all of this without him, especially without Ben here. Maybe my reaction was too strong back then, Davi was wrong but so was I. Even with differences it’s not impossible to work things through.</text>
