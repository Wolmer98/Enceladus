  <text>A growler dug itself through the wall. I didn’t think that was possible. I just remember Noémie screaming at me to grab my gun and shoot. I don’t remember much, I ran on adrenaline. The monster died but with all the doors locked we had no choice but to hide in the water lock. I saw that Noémie got hurt, a piece of metal broke off and was projected by the water streams and gave her a fairly serious cut on her calf. She tried to play it off as a small thing but I couldn’t have her bleed out in the room with me, so I forced her to comply with emergency treatment. I need to get her to my equipment and stitch it still.</text>
