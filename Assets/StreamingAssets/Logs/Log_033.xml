  <text>I got knocked out for a few hours, I made a mistake with the battery. I haven’t worked with this older model before and it sent me flying. No other harm done though, just some more hours of work required. Ben got me to Teiko so I could get patched up as well. A bump on my head, nothing too bad. It hurts quite a bit when a geyser erupts however. There’s two of them, the previous researchers even gave them nicknames. Must have annoyed them just as much. Quiver and Quake they’re called. Must’ve been some kind of a joke, even Quiver which is the smaller of the two makes the base shake like it’s going to fall apart.
