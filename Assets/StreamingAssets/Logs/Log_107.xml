  <text>The cold was at first just inconvenient but now itâ€™s causing problems. The growlers are used to the warm temperatures of Enceladus core so the tanks we keep them in has been heated. But now that water is cooling and the growlers are suffering. They are becoming more aggressive and might eventually break something, or succumb to the cold and pass away. Either way we need to get this situation sorted.</text>
