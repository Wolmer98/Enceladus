  <text>I’m mostly stuck in the lab helping with the research or doing security related work. Breaks are few, far between and usually spent in an old recreation room. The sofas are murky but quite comfortable. We even have a coffee machine. Problem is that we aren’t that many here, it’s usually just me, Teiko and Noémie and those two can never stop getting on each others’ cases. It gets a bit better when Priya joins us. She should do it more often, she could use some relaxation. Maybe I can convince Omar to join us, he seems to prefer the solitude but it would be nice to avoid the drama for a bit.
