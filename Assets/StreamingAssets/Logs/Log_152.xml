  <text>Davi said that he was willing to compromise and won’t say anything more about my friendship with Ben. He will also try to treat Ben as a member of the crew. I’m worried I’m making another mistake, I don’t want to be dissapointed like that again. But he was so desperate for a second chance I couldn’t really say no. Androids are a dealbreaker for me and Davi’s acceptance of them, with what he’s gone through, won’t come easy. At the same time it’s scary how easy it’s for me to take him back. I missed him a lot.</text>
