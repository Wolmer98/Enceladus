  <text>I talked a lot about my military days today. I don’t do that too much usually, but Omar seemed happy to listen to me talk. Naturally I got dragged away, but I kept it light though as there's no need to burden him with my regrets. Once I might have dreamed about the glory and honor of fighting for my country, but nothing's quite as effective at destroying those dreams than war. There’s nothing glorious about the dead bodies of your friends around you. I’ve tried to put those days behind me, to fight for people instead of against them, but the images still remain.
