  <text>Ben is in the android repair station right now, he’s too damaged for me to try to fix. We’ll have to trust that the machine can repair him. He got hurt when we went to fetch growlers, we got jumped by some small ones and Ben shielded us. I couldn’t do anything, I was too scared I’d accidentally hit him. Davi shot them down, one by one but by the time they were all dead Ben had already taken massive damage. I couldn’t do anything. I felt so helpless. Please be ok.</text>
