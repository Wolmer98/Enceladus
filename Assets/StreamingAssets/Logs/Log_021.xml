  <text>I’m helping out where I can, luckily there doesn’t seem like any creatures have made their way inside so I haven’t had to use my guns. There’s still some time until we’re ready to bring any of them inside so they will have to rest for a bit longer. The place is feeling pretty cramped, Noémie is fixing up rooms as fast as she can, but with her and Teiko’s bouts it’s hard to find a quiet moment. Whenever I try to escape I usually run into Omar, I don’t mind though, he’s quiet and peaceful. Only thing is that the android often is with him, seeing them still gives me the jitters.</text>
