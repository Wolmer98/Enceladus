  <text>We were stuck for a while before they could come get us. I tried to keep to myself in the corner, didn’t want to cause another fight. I’m a bit tired of it, all the bickering. Teiko wouldn’t leave me alone though, of course she wouldn’t. I’d gotten a scratch on my leg during the fight and wouldn’t give in until she could give it emergency treatment. Whatever. I let her. I even let her stitch it when we came back to the others. Before even getting a chance to warm up and dry she insisted on doing it. During the entire time she wasn’t her usual hostile self. She was even helpful. I guess I owe her one. Never thought I’d say that.</text>
