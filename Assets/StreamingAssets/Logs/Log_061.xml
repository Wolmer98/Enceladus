  <text>I got told off for not writing enough logs. Like we have time for that. We have to find a way to extract D77. The sea-life on Enceladus has the richest concentration of the substance in possibly the entire galaxy. D77 is a vital component in Aluzim, the only drug that has shown to be able to treat and prevent dementia. Problem is that D77 is extremely rare except for here. I imagine that to be a little bit more important than writing in our diaries.</text>
