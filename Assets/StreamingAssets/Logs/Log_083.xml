  <text>Things are calmer now, but there’s still this awkwardness hanging around. I rarely see Noémie as she’s out working elsewhere and Teiko has started to act like she never existed. We’re getting things done, but I don’t like leaving the conflict unresolved like this. It’ll explode someday. It makes me miss my family a lot, they might be rowdy but they all love each other. Davi is keeping me company and that’s making it bearable. Ever since I stopping by the recreation room it feels like Davi has come to me more often. Maybe I was too hasty thinking he dislikes me, I have to stop doing that.</text>
