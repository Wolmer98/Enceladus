  <text>When I last talked to Priya I naïvely thought that I had persuaded her from any ideas concerning shutting off the shields. And now she decides to do it without talking to me again? Quiver is the one with the shortest eruption cycle and with their estimated time to complete experiment they’ll have a 15 minute margin to work with. That is not a lot, considering how irregular and early Quiver’s eruptions can be. And it’s not like we can just turn everything off if we notice Quiver erupting. It’ll take at least ten minutes to get the shields back online. They’re playing it too close, there’s no way nothing would go wrong.</text>
