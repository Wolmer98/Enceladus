  <text>I’ve done it, the heater is repaired. The base should be back to normal in a few days. Priya says she’ll help me with PanPha if necessary, but since it didn’t create that big of an issue PanPha might not punish me too harshly. I’m not looking forward to it, but I feel more mentally prepared for it now. I’m not a kid anymore, and the work I’m doing have extensive consequences. Just because I’m new it doesn’t excuse some of the things I’ve done. I’ll do better from now on, and stop feeling down because of Davi as well. I’m even worrying Ben, I have to get myself together.</text>
