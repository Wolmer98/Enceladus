  <text>Noémie is already getting started, I don’t get where she gets the energy for that. They weren’t joking about her experience with space travel then, recovering this quickly. I’ll join her as soon as I can. This place has been abandoned for six decades already and we don’t know if the base has been compromised. Before that there’s some other things I have to tend to. The oxygen level is a bit low and so is the gravity. I’ll also have to look at the shields and the heating. It’s freezing in here.</text>
