  <text>It’s the middle of the night, I woke up cold sweating and with uneven breathing. In my dream PanPha was angry with me again, threatening to bring us back to earth. I know it isn’t true, they are proud of our accomplishments, but I don’t think I can go back to sleep. Might as well head to the lab and get some more done. I’ll prove those dreams wrong with the results from our research.</text>
