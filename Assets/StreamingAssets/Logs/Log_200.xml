  <text>I’ve sat next to Omar as he fixes the last things with the cryoextractor. I’ve done everything I can, the shields are ready to be turned off at any time. I’m working on another weapon mod, it’s a bit unstable at the moment but is very powerful. It’s something to do while we wait. Omar is nervous, but he looks pretty happy. I worry him, I’m sure of it. Despite my best attempts, I’m not very good at pretending it seems. I’m not strong enough to stay away though. Would’ve been better with Ben here, he’s at least never gloomy. I want Omar to be happy to the end, not dread it like I do.</text>
