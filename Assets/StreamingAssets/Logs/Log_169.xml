  <text>Noémie complained to me that the growlers weren’t fed. It’s not ideal, I’ll admit, we would’ve liked to use that flesh ourselves, but for now it’ll have to do. The growlers can last pretty long without food and we’d planned to kill them before it became an issue. Like usual however, things got in the way, causing us to slow our use of growlers. With the heat failure and the cryoextractor we’ve been kept busy. I feel like capturing reapers or stingers to feed them would take more work than it’s worth as well. To Noémie I just said it’s my orders. It’s fine if she’s mad at me, I don’t want her to fight more with Teiko if I can help it.</text>
