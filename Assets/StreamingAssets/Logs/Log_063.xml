  <text>After talking to Robert I decided to check out some of the upgrades Davi have made for the guns. I often see him tinkering with the guns when he has some spare time. I went to the shooting range but before my finger got to the trigger Davi yanked the gun away. Davi is usually a pretty laid back guy, it’s rare to see him that stern. I got myself a small lecture on gun safety, apparently the one I’d taken wasn’t very stable yet. He showed me some of the others he’d done though, they felt really good. Well, good to know he takes security and safety seriously. At first I was slightly hesitant when I heard our head of security was an ex soldier and a gun enthusiast, but he seems to have a decent head on his shoulders.</text>
