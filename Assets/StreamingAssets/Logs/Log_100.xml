  <text>Ben told me to come with him to the lab and it had me immediately worried. When I entered they all jumped out and yelled “Surprise!”. I had forgotten it was my birthday, I’ve had my mind everywhere else. They even had Kasim and Lathika up on the big screen. It was just a short break with some food, but we were all there and talked about things other than work. They even got Max away from their research. I got a bit touched, I hadn’t suspected it at all.</text>
