  <text>I’ve tried to avoid him, didn’t want him to see me like this, but Davi found me eventually. He gave me a talk. I actually felt better afterwards, even if embarrassed. I messed up, but the important thing is that I fix it. There’s parts I can scavenge from other machines, the rest I’ll have to make myself. I wasted precious time already.</text>
