  <text>It’s nearing Priya’s birthday, I know she wants nothing with it and only for all of us to work, no time for fun and games and yada yada. But I feel like she needs a break, she’s too stressed about too many things. So I’m looking around if we can’t make a small surprise party happen. Just for half an hour or so, that much we can spare. I’ll be looking into preparations whenever I get the time.</text>
