  <text>There was something I wanted to test, so I brought some food with me outside. The files say the reapers are carnivores and their teeth definitely look like they could be. I was curious what would happen if I tried to feed one so I offered a piece of meat to one that got close. It took it immediately and it didn’t take long for several of them to flock around the cage and playfully fight each other for the food. They reminded me a little of my huskies at home, only they ruffled the cage harder when they accidentally bumped into it. I miss my dogs, Robert too. I’ll have to call them soon.</text>
