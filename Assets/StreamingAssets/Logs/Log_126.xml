  <text>I don’t know how to write this, I’m still too angry. Davi came by to “talk” about my friendship with Ben. He tried to tell me how callous and untrustworthy androids are, that Ben is fooling me and I should keep my distance. I’d noticed somewhat, but never paid close attention to that Davi doesn’t like Ben all too much. Won’t look him in the eye, avoiding to talk to or about him and such. I should’ve listened so I wouldn’t have to feel so betrayed right now. Ben is my only friend here, and androids are the only ones that have stayed by me besides my family. Nothing is as loyal as an android, and Ben is more precious than most.</text>
