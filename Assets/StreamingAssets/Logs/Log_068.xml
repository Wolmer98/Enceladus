  <text>The Teiko-Noémie situation has blown up to new proportions. Davi dealt with Noémie so she’s calmed down, but Teiko came to me fuming. She wants me to ban Noémie from the research areas because of her disruption earlier. I don’t want to use my leadership that way, to restrict members of my crew, but I don’t see any other options. The research is the most important thing here and Teiko is a vital part of it. Noémie’s work has been crucial to get the base up and running, but she isn’t needed around the labs anymore.</text>
