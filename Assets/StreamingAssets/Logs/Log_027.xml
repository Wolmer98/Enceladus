  <text>Another room caved in and filled with water. The doors seal the water to that room, so the damage will be contained until Noémie can fix the hole. I did good this time though, barely jumped as I heard it happen. I’m out in space with six other people, but I swear it manages to be noisier than Jabud where almost a billion people live. Geyser eruptions, things breaking, creature sounds, pressure difference, every sound is something hoping to kill you. Noémie says that the rooms she’s cleared is safe and we can only trust her.</text>
