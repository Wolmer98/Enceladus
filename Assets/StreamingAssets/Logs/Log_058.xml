  <text>All Gaia 7 crew members have to write logs, documenting their work and thoughts. It’s a PanPha policy, something about mental health and all that. It’s only a special confidential section at the company that can read them, so we don’t have to worry about what we’re saying. At least that’s what the others told me and they haven’t gotten into trouble yet. Ben is also a part of the crew and I’ve been thinking about that for quite a while, so I told him that he should write logs like the rest of us.</text>
