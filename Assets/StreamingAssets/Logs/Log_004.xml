  <text>I’ve just reported to PanPha that the Gaia 7 has arrived. The crew is alive and sound, well Max is feeling down in the gutter but we knew they can’t handle space travel very well. With some exercise and food they’ll feel much better. I know Max will argue with me on this, but I’ve traveled with them before. I know how this works. Noémie is already up and inspecting the place. Hopefully both us and the base will be ready to start researching shortly. We don’t have too much time.</text>
