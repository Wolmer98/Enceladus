  <text>It has become so natural to talk to Davi, we’re talking almost daily and hanging out. Still gives me butterflies whenever I see him, but I’m less scared that he’ll find me awkward or weird. I wish someone could tell me if he likes me as well. A small part of me tells me that he might, but I’ve been wrong before. I certainly like him, it’s kinda scary. It’s easy to be with Ben though, he’s my safe zone. It’s nice to have somebody I can tell everything too and never worry.</text>
