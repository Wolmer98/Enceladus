  <text>The wound on my leg is completely healed. I guess Teiko has access to some better stuff than I do, because that was fast. Maybe it was stubborn of me to not accept her help earlier. No matter the motivations she’s better at it than me and I should make sure to stay healthy. I’ve had a few days off so I’ve had some time to talk to Robert. I haven’t called him in a few months now, I get caught up with work. I’m always surprised that he stays with me, being gone as much as I’m and with little communication. He’s even keeping an eye on my boys. I hope I’ll see him soon.</text>
