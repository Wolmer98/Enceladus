  <text>I’m doing my best to keep PanPha off our backs, we just need a little more time before we get a breakthrough. Max is working day and night, they would be missing meals if Ben didn’t constantly bring food to them. The new SA-M4300 model is really something, we don’t have to tell him to do most things, he just looks after us. It gives us more time to focus on the research. Teiko and Noémie, however, are only causing me headaches. I wish they could stop with their childish bickering. I’m not picking sides or favorites, but Teiko is essential to the research so I’ll have to ask Noémie to work more outside. That way they should both be able to get more work done.</text>
