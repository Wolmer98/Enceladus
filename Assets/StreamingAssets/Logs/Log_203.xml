  <text>There’s nothing more I can do before the experiment. I didn’t manage to shave off as much time as I would’ve wanted, but the others seem sure it’ll be enough. I’ll be in the lab during the experiment, so I can be there if anything happens to the cryoextractor. Davi will be in the control room to overlook the shields. That means I’ll have to come up with something to say to him before we seperate. I know it isn’t the last time we meet or anything, but it feels like the end of something. I’ll have to visit Ben as well. He’s still repairing but I owe him a visit. I wish he could be here with me.</text>
