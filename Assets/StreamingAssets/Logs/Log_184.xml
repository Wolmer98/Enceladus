  <text>I’ll give Priya my permission to the experiment. When she first came by I refused but Davi convinced me to do it still. He assured me that it was safe for me to agree because as long as he doesn’t, Priya shouldn’t be able to go through with it. Davi is acting weird lately, but to be honest I’m glad to be back to work on the cryoextractor. I’ll see if I can’t make this machine safe to run. It’s going to be lonely to work in the lab without Ben with me. Davi won’t be able to accompany me either unless he agrees to do the experiment as well.</text>
