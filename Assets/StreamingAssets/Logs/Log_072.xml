  <text>We’re making progress, but we’re not getting any results. Every step merely inches us closer to the mountains in the distance. Teiko is getting frustrated, but that’s a given. I know we’ll get there with enough time, but time is a finite resource. Priya tries to hide it but I see on them the pressure PanPha is putting on them. We all need this, this has to work for Priya’s sake and my own. I don’t like talking to them, they are too roundabout about everything, but I’ll have to make them a call.
