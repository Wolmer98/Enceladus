  <text>I had a bad dream. Well, I often do but this one was particularly bad. I had to get up and go to the lab. Max was still working so I joined them. Good company Max, they don’t ask personal questions even when you look and feel like shit. The android wasn’t there either, it had to charge. The job was a bit mundane though, which me time to think. About the war, and the pictures that never left me.</text>
