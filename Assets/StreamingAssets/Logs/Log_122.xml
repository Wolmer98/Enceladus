  <text>Much has happened but we’re out and we’re safe. I’m still a bit shook, my thoughts are messy. A few things are clear though, now I know that when it really matters Noémie is on our side, not the monsters. She killed that thing and without her I’m not sure I’d made it out. The water lock was her idea. She did warn me that it wasn’t safe, maybe I should’ve listened a bit better. I guess I can’t blame her for yelling at me when I went against her words previously, I get pissed as well when she does reckless things.</text>
