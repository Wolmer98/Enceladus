  <text>We’re just ready to get the testing started, and in the nick of time. I’ve just talked to PanPha and they are under a lot of pressure. Since we have arrived the backlash has just gotten worse. Especially the Alien Life Preservation group is giving them issues. We need to get good results so they can appease the crowds. Max is dying to get started, so when we get that first subject up I know they won’t stop working for days. Teiko is excited as well, with guys like these we’re bound to get some results.
