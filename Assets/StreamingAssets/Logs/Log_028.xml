  <logName>The growler trap</logName>

  <text>I took a look at the trap used to catch the crablike creatures at the bottom of the ocean. Growlers, the previous researchers seemed to called them. They are apparently very sensitive to vibrations so they drop a cage to the floor, sends vibrations from the middle and wait until it fills up. I had Noémie with me, the contraption was a bit further in and we have to be careful in these rooms. The area looks fairly intact though, Noémie and I can probably fix the trap without Omar’s help. He’s busy as it is.</text>
