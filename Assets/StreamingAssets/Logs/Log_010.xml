  <text>The android watched over us the entire time we spent traveling through space. All that time alone, with no other company than blipping screens. He’s going to be with us for quite some time and needs a proper name. I’ve seen people give androids names based on their model number, our android is an SA-M4300, but I don’t like that. He’s more than just his model and should be given a name like everyone else. I’m thinking of calling him Ben. He’s been helping me out repairing the old machines, trying to get this place running. He’s been of great help.</text>
