  <text>The heating system failed and temperature is quickly dropping. Me, Omar and Ben checked on it and it’s going to take a while to fix it, we hadn’t realized it was in such bad condition. The moisture of this place must’ve gotten to it in the end. The ocean water keeps us from freezing over but we’re poorly equipped for this.</text>
