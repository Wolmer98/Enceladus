  <text>I dropped by the lab and Max’s hamsters are up on a counter. It’s very like Max to bring their pets to a distant moon. Funny and Romeo they’re called, Lathika named them. Well I’m glad at least someone is here as Max works into the middle of the night. The rest of us can’t keep up, even Ben has to charge for a few hours. We have to get our communication center set up as well, I can’t wait until I see Lathika’s face again.</text>
