  <text>Davi is going to give Priya his permission. Is this ok? I know Priya has PanPha behind her now, but does that mean we should give up so easily? Maybe Davi understand things that I don’t. I’m worried about him, he looks broken down about it. I’m sure we’ll be fine. Davi is worried because of the worst case scenario, which is bad I’ll admit, but the chance of that happening is pretty small. Most likely we’ll be fine and then we can go home. I can meet my family again and Davi might be able to find his brother.</text>
