  <text>I found Omar hunched down in a corner, he’s not taking the heating failure very well, putting all the blame on himself and breaking down. He didn’t really want it but I had a talk with him. Everyone makes mistakes, what matters is what you do about it. The heater can be fixed and the mission can continue, Omar just has to repair the machine. I’ve seen him repair a lot of things since we got here and I have no doubt in mind that he can’t fix this one just as well. He just needs to get his head back in the game.</text>
