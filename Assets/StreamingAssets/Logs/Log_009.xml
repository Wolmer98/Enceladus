  <text>This place is really fascinating. Etna S was built 70 years ago to study the life found here on Enceladus. It was an expensive ordeal, I can’t believe they shut it down after just a few years. But it’s thanks to their research and making of this base that I could get this mission greenlit. The base has kept together surprisingly well I must say, but many repairs will be necessary before we can get started.</text>
