  <text>I know Noémie isn’t allowed near the labs and it’s nice and quiet, but does she have to be outside the base all the time? Love those beasts all you like but could you please not put yourself in more danger than necessary? It creates more work for the rest of us. Like what would we do if she got hurt out there? It wouldn’t exactly be easy to go out and get her. Those monsters are everywhere, it’s not safe.  Stubborn mules and their readiness to jump into danger.</text>
