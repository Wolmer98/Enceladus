  <text>Teiko and Max are running the data on the geysers, trying to predict when would be the perfect time for us to run the experiment. We preferably want to do it just as Quiver and Quake has erupted simultaneously so we have the most possible time to run the test. Quiver is the important one since it’s the one with the shortest intervals between eruptions. Davi is worried about the safety risks, I knew he would be and that’s why I didn’t want to tell him until we had more data. If we do our math correctly the risks will be minimal.</text>
