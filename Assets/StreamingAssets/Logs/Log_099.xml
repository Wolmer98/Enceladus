  <text>I was making repair on my own earlier, Ben was busy. The repair was difficult and took longer than expected. I knew a geyser would erupt soon but I didn’t expect it to be that early. Should’ve taken the clue when the reapers swam away. I was on my way back when the tons of water gushed out, knocking me around the cage. I think I lost consciousness for a moment, took me a few minutes to reorient me even after getting back inside. The Inspector says I’m fine though, it only hurts like hell. It’s nothing I need to worry the others with, even if they did care.</text>
