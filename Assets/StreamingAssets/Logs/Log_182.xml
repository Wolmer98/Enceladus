  <text>I’ve had some time to calm down. It’s not like me to lose my cool like that. I should’ve learnt from last time to handle it better. But I’m responsible for the security of these people, and Omar’s safety. He followed me, I wasn’t sure he would, unlike me he likes PanPha and dislikes conflicts. I’d have understood if he’d stayed with the others. I’m not sure what happened, I thought we were doing well. I’ve always been the lesser off the scientists on the team, but I’ve always felt included in the research. Now, it feels like a strict line has been drawn. Between those three and the newcomers. We all find our mission here important but I don’t know what pushed them to become so fanatic. I just want all of us to get back home safe.</text>
