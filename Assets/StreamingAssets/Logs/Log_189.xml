  <text>We’ve managed to shave off 10 minutes of our estimated time to complete the experiment. Mostly Omar’s work, but I helped. I’m not even going to bring these news to Noémie, I know that even if it took five seconds to complete, she’d be against it. Her dear crab creatures are just too precious. Fuck everyone suffering from Alzheimer's or those with a relative or close one with dementia. Fuck Max’s mother. These stinky, slimy, screaming little creatures are so much more important than everyone back home. I wish Priya would just pull the levers, we don’t need the approval from someone like her to do this.</text>
