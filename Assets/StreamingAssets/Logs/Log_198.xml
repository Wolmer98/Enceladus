  <text>Davi has agreed to handle the shields. It’s good to have him back. I know his worry comes from the right place. I called Lathika today, probably my last chance to do so before the experiment. There will be many chances to talk to her afterwards, but nerves are coursing through my body. Expectation, but also some worry. We have to make sure everything goes perfectly. No mistakes can be allowed. I’ll have to make sure everything is perfect.</text>
