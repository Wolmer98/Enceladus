  <text>I’ve noticed that some of the other’s have started to call the android by a name. I feel like naming it can be dangerous, makes it appear too human. They already look like us, we shouldn’t make the borders any more muddled. I’m especially worried about Omar, he seems pretty close to the thing. If he’d seen what I have, he would’ve shared my sentiment. The only thing that makes this one different from the monsters on the battlefields is some code to cover it up.</text>
