  <text>I brought Ben with me to hang out with the others. Ben isn’t always much for conversation, but neither am I and I was welcomed. Davi seemed a bit distant today, I wonder if something is wrong? Maybe I’ve come here too often and he’s gotten tired of telling me stories and playing pool. Maybe if I come here less often, he’ll not get as tired of me. I always have work to occupy myself with and Ben will keep me company.</text>
