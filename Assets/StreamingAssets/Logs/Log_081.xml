  <text>Maybe I let it get to me too much. Max talked to me and they’re right, I’m thinking too much about things that aren’t work. I have to zone out Noémie, PanPha, the lack of progress and get things done instead. We might not be many but we have Max, the most brilliant person I’ve ever met. They’ve spent half their life studying and the rest working for PanPha and honing their skills. And they do it not expecting anything in return, only living for science and its progress. If there’s anyone who can do it it’s Max and I couldn’t be more proud to be their assistant.</text>
