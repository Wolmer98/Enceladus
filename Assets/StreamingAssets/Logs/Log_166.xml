  <text>I’m stumped. We’re making a lot of improvements to the machine used to cool and extract the D77 but we’re still just able to extract a minuscule portion of the substance out of the flesh. The rest still falls apart. We’re calling the machine a cryoextractor. I haven’t named anything like this before so I don’t know if it’s any good, but the others seem to use it as well. Max has this idea of how we could make a much bigger version of it that could extract a higher percentage. I actually think it could work, problem is that it would take much more energy than we have at our disposal to run. I still find it worth to look into however.</text>
