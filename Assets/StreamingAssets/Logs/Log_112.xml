  <text>Outside the base nothing has changed. My suit keeps me warm out in the water. I made a rare sighting today, a lurker who hid in the shadows. Not much is known about these guys, they are a pretty rare find. The previous researchers thought that they might be going extinct, I’m glad to see that they are still around. It’s good that it didn’t get any closer though, with their size they probably wouldn’t struggle with taking this cage apart. Thinking of it, some damage to the base I’ve found might have been caused by them.</text>
