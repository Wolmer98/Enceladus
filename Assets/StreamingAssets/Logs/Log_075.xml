  <text>I made a call home, wasn’t allowed to do it until now. Mother was confused and wouldn’t recognize me. Strange that you’d at my age find it so important to have your mother call you by your name. They’d never call me by my nickname, it would always be ‘Massimiliano’. They’re probably the only person to do so, not even I say that name anymore. If we succeed with our mission I might be able to hear it again.
