  <text>So far we’ve only captured the very large growlers but they are much rarer and more dangerous than the small ones. Priya asked me to modify the trap to catch the small ones as well. I just have to make the holes smaller, it will not take too much time. I’m not looking forward trying to empty a cage full of them though, just one is annoying enough to get where I want.</text>
