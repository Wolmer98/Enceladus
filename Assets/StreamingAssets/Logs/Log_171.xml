  <text>I talked to Priya about the growlers and she completely dismissed me. I used to feel like Priya was the mediator of the team, the one who listened to everyone and tried to make a fair decision. Even when I drew the short end of the stick I accepted it for the best of the crew. But she hasn’t picked my side even once, has she? Sending me outside, banning me from the labs, ignoring my opinions. I’m not just somebody here to repair holes, I’m a part of the team, yet I feel like they take every chance to exclude me. I’m not normally one to care much about that but this time I feel like it’s important.</text>
