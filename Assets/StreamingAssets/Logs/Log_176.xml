  <text>Priya has decided that we’ll turn off the shields to power the experiment. Then we can stop wasting time trying to find other solutions and focus on the important things. Like when we’ll run the experiment. The base will be vulnerable during the experiment and there’s over a hundred geysers on Enceladus. Only two of those are close enough to hit us so it’s them we’ll have to keep an eye on. They have different lengths between eruptions so the best time would have to be right after they have erupted simultaneously.</text>
