  <logName>Addressing Ben’s logs</logName>

  <text>I asked Ben how the logs where going and he’s been writing them. He shared with me what he wrote and they are very Ben, so to say. To the point and literal. I know he can do much more than that, he has great analytical abilities and intellect. So I’ve challenged him to write longer and show more of that. Also to add titles, just numbering them won’t do.</text>
