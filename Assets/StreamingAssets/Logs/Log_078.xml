  <text>It’s only me, Max, Priya and Davi who have the expertise to help with the experiments. Omar is brilliant with the machines and tools but is working after our instructions. Davi isn’t as high level as the rest of us as he chose to specialize in weaponry instead and Priya has many other preoccupations. We’re lacking people and hours for this. What difference it would’ve made if they could have found an actual scientist who also can knock on walls to bring with us instead of Noémie. I mean it has been nice and quiet with her gone, but she’s filling a space someone more useful could’ve taken.
