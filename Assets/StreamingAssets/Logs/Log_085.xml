  <text>I’m surprised they even asked me to fix the tanks once used to host growlers. Teiko seems sure I’ll sabotage it, but jokes on her, I’m planning to get this job done and then be out of here. Whatever regrets I may have I’d lose all credibility I’ve worked up in the industry if I did anything rash. The tank is needed since the growlers can’t swim and has to be fetched from the ocean floor. Using the trap every time they need one wastes too much time, with the tanks they have one ready whenever they need one. At least it’s kept warm to mimic their natural habitat.</text>
