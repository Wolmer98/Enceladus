  <text>For the first time I saw how they captured and killed the growlers. They shot it up and let it bleed out on the floor. The sounds it made were horrific, I’ve never heard anything like it. I can’t believe they’ve been doing this without me knowing. The worst part of it was Teiko. The growler barely had time to draw it’s last breath before she came up with a knife and cut it out from the shell. I was disgusted by it, and told them as much. Teiko got livid and Davi pulled me away. I don’t regret it, somebody needed to say something about what they were doing.</text>
