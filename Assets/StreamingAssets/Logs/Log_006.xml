  <text>It’s weird to think that we’re under several kilometers of ice. We had to take an elevator down, leave everything else at the top. Etna S is stuck to the underside of the ice, submerged in water and perfect for researching the creatures here. Not so perfect for getting out though, all the escape pods are up at the surface. I’ve never been anywhere that has felt this cramped before, and that comes from someone who grew up with seven siblings.</text>
