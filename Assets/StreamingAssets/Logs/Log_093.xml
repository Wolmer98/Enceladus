  <text>I finally got to talk to my family again. PanPha reached out to them and had them taken to their lab for me. Not everyone was there, but I got to see my mom, the twins and Nijah. I told them about what I’ve been doing and about the team. I only mentioned Davi breefely, as soon as I mention a guy in any detail my mom will ask me if I like them. In this case I do, but it’s not a conversation I really want to have. She’d blow it into unprecedented proportions in mere seconds. I asked Nijah about school instead. She lit up like the sun and told me about everyone in her class until their time was up and they had to leave. I miss when things were uncomplicated.</text>
