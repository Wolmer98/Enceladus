  <text>We have just arrived at Etna S and the crew has awoken from their induced coma. They look to be in good condition, no complications this time. Max is nauseous, not an uncommon side effect. Other common side effects are fatigue, stiffness and difficulty focusing. The effect usually becomes lesser the more you do it, Max just drew the short end of the stick. I’m surprised by how well Omar is doing though, this is his first time and he doesn’t look any worse than the rest of us. As soon as the gravity is back to normal I’ll have us all start exercise. It’ll help remove any excess residues from our system.</text>
