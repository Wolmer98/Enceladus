  <text>I’ve been working so much I haven’t noticed much else. I know a breakthrough is in here somewhere, it’s like it’s on the tip of my tongue but I just can’t come up with what it is. The lack of sedation definitely helped, kept the substance purer. We need something more though, something to keep it stable through the extraction.</text>
