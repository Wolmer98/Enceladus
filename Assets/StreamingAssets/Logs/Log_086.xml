  <text>I’ve spent most of the day releasing more traps and fishing up trapped growlers and putting them in the tanks. It’ll be easier and quicker now to get a new growler when they are needed. Even the large ones we’re working through quickly. The danger comes when you open the tank to let one in or out. Even in captivity they are dangerous and there’s always the worry that one will break out.</text>
