  <text>I just talked to Priya, about Teiko of all things. I think she’s trying to mediate between the two of us. It’s up to Teiko really. I don’t particularly want to fight, I’m kind of tired of it to be honest, but I’m not going to back down because of peace. I didn’t know Teiko had been married. Priya talked some about her husband. He had a similar work to me and constantly headed out to space. He died out on a mission and after that Teiko dove into work. Not very subtle from Priya to tell me that but, I guess Teko can have my condolences.</text>
