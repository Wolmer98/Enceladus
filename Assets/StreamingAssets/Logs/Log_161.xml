  <text>I had some coffee with Teiko earlier. There was some small talk, but I’m not one to beat around the bush. I asked something I’ve wondered for a long time. Why did she become a doctor? It’s no secret that she’s more interested in biochemistry. She mentioned her husband and wasn’t too happy that Priya had told me about him. Anyway it seems like she became a doctor because his work was dangerous. A much more noble reason than I had thought, I must admit. Unfortunately he died in an accident before she could finish her degree and follow him to space. Maybe I haven’t given Teiko enough credit. She even finished her studies after her loss. The reapers managed to win me over, maybe so could she.</text>
