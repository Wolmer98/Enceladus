  <text>I was making repairs to the growler tank when Teiko came by. The growlers have been causing a ruckus ever since the cold started and the tank had started to give in. There’s just so much I could do from the outside and a growler started to break through the metal. There wasn’t much time to act, both me and Teiko had to reach for our guns and try to kill the thing. Not the easiest thing with water gushing in and difficulty reaching its weak spots. We managed somehow, before the beast breached and let everyone out. Problem was that the water had made all the doors emergency lock. We’ve escaped into the water lock that takes you to the outside, but we’re stuck here.</text>
