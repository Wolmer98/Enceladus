  <text>We’re running all sorts of tests trying to extract D77 from the growler flesh. Still waiting on the results. Noémie mentioned that they’ve met reapers outside. Also known as encelus lacetus. Very social creatures who live in large packs. Carnivores who mostly feed on belchers and stingers. Interestingly they can’t swim as they sleep, so they usually find rocks on the ocean floor to rest on. They take turn to guard, but they still lose members to growlers. But when humans came here and built Etna S we gave them a place safe from growlers so now they sleep in the different nooks and crannies on our base.
