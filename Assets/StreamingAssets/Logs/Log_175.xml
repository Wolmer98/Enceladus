  <text>I talked to PanPha earlier, they were inquiring how we were doing and I knew I had to say something. I told them we are putting together a bigger experiment and they can expect results soon. I was hesitant earlier to actually go through with it, but now I see that this is the only way. This experiment is going to make or break this mission.</text>
