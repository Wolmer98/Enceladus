  <text>I got a small cut on my arm, nothing I can’t patch up myself. Teiko treated it like some big deal, insisting that she should fix it up. I like how she tries to appear like she cares about her job, we all know she’s doesn’t give a shit about anything but the research. Anyone can tell she only studied medicine for the merits. Getting into PanPha with only a biochemistry degree is pretty difficult. I’d go to Ben before I ask her for help, at least he wants to help us.
