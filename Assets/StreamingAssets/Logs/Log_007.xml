  <text>I’ve taken a look at what the previous research team have left us, we have most of the machines and systems they used back then, but the computers seem to have been wiped clean before they left. We have some data with us that they published after coming back, but I’d hoped to find a scoop here. I guess we’ll have to work with what we have. Omar and the android are trying to get some machines up and running so we can begin. Max will feel better as soon as they can start working.</text>
