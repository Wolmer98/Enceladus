  <text>I try my best to handle the team and our mission, but with all the issues we’re having I don’t feel like I’m doing a very good job. I had to do something very drastic just to make Teiko and Noémie stop fighting but it didn’t resolve anything, just postponed it. But I don’t see any other way. PanPha is losing patience with us since we’re not showing any results. They’d expected us to at least produce a small amount of D77 by now and to be honest, so had I. But we’re drawing closer aren’t we? Damnit can’t they have a little perspective? Just a little more time and money and they’ll have the goldmine that is D77. PanPha will get their cash and regain their approval. Aluzim would also help millions of people and all of our hard work will be worth it. If they shut this down, everything will be for naught.</text>
