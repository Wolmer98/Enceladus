  <text>Noémie continues to baffle me. I know she isn’t a scientist, but even she should understand the importance of our work. Animals have always been used in science and it’s extremely naïve of her if she expected anything else when she got here. I don’t even know if you can call the growlers animals anyway, they are just beasts scavenging whatever dead or living that reach them on the ocean floor. I’m telling Priya that she better bar Noémie from ever getting close to our research again.</text>
