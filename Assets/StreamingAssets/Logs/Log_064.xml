  <text>PanPha is starting to get impatient. I’m hesitant to ask more of my team as they are already working this hard, but we need results or we are going to be sent home empty handed. I can’t have that happen. This is my first expedition and we worked hard to make it happen. If we fail I’ll never be trusted as team leader again. I left the lab because this is what I want to do. Max supports me because they think I can do it.</text>
