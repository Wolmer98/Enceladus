  <text>Large areas of the heater’s core has corroded and it’ll take me time to fix it. I looked it over when we arrived here and I didn’t notice any of this, I don’t know how it could’ve failed so catastrophically. I must have missed something, that’s not allowed to happen. The mission is in peril and it’s my fault. PanPha gave the chance of my life and I blew it at the first opportunity.</text>
