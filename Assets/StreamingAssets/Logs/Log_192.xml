  <text>I don’t know how but Priya got PanPha’s blessings for the experiment. How? I thought PanPha liked to play it much safer than this, and there’s so much they could lose, The Etna S, who’s their only foothold on Enceladus, and us, some of the best people in the business. Not to mention the hit their precious reputation would take. I contacted PanPha as soon as I heard but they wouldn’t listen. I don’t know what lies Priya told them, but they are in love with the idea and brushing off any danger. Is the cash that important? For all of our sakes I hope this experiment goes well.</text>
