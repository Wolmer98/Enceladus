  <text>I’ve decided that me and Noémie can try to start again. I know I’m not exactly the nicest person, and she can be pretty annoying herself, but recent events have made me rethink some things I’ve thought about her. Maybe we just got off on the wrong foot. She’s been less of a pain lately as well. Not sure if it’s just because I’m not fighting her or because she is also rethinking things. Either way I think I’ll give it a try.</text>
