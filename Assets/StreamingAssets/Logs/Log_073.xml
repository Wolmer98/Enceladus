  <text>Max contacted PanPha. They shouldn’t have, dealing with PanPha is my responsibility. I’m grateful though, I don’t know what Max told them but they’re willing to give us some more time. I’m really glad Max is here with me, I know I can always count on them. They’ve stood by my side since I first entered PanPha as a lab assistant.
