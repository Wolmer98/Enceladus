  <text>Noémie went outside again. I don’t get what she sees out there, nothing could make me go back there. We were only there for a few minutes and it was ice cold and the reapers were prancing around, waiting for their chance. I talked to Noémie about it and she simply said it was Priya’s orders. That didn’t feel right so I went directly to Priya. It was true. She tried to say it was because they needed repairs outside, but I wasn’t buying it. We didn’t need it to that extent. I didn’t give in until I got answers. Priya then told me it was because of me, so we wouldn’t get at each other’s throats. Do you think I want her death on my conscience? I ordered her to make Noémie stop that immediately.</text>
