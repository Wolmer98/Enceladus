  <text>The party was a success, you could see Priya’s shoulders lower by several centimeters throughout it. My biggest worry was Noémie and Teiko, they have barely been in the same room for weeks. But it seems like they care about Priya enough to keep it civil, for which I’m glad. Noémie didn’t look too well though, almost shaken. She tries to hide it but the exile must’ve hit her pretty hard. I’ll have to look out for her, even if it’s partially her fault I’m not happy with how she’s treated.</text>
