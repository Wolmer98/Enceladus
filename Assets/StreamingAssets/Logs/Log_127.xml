  <text>I fucked up. I tried to tell Omar how dangerous it’s to get close to the androids like he does, I tried to bring it up gently. Everything backfired, Omar hates me and is locked himself in with the heater and the android. I wanted to save him the heartbreak, but instead pushed him closer to the android. I would’ve kept my mouth shut if I knew this would happen. He won’t talk to me now and it hurts more than I thought it would.</text>
