  <text>I hadn’t been back outside since the accident. I’d loitered around enough so I put on the wetsuit and headed out. I don’t know why but I felt a bit nervous. I took some time just staying in the water, getting used to it again. The reapers weren’t scared of course, curiously grabbing the cage and singing to each other. I don’t know what I was worried about, I should’ve been back out there again long ago.</text>
